HI everyone, my name is Luke, but most people know me as biolizardshadow. At the moment, I am a college student and rom hacker. I started rom hacking a year and a half ago and it 
has been a wild ride for me since then. I compose music and add it to games on the Gameboy Advance or Nintendo DS, but my focus right now is on the Gameboy Advance as I have been 
fascinated by the audio hardware on the GBA for a long time. I post game patches here for all to download for free. My goal here is to bring new life into some of these older 
games and show off my skills in the process.
